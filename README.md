# FASE

Finding Alternative Splicing Events (FASE) 

FASE can find differential alternatively spliced exons and introns from RNA-Sequencing data. Further, it can use the expression of these events and their associated meta-features to find survival rate of samples/patients.

FASE also provides wrapper functions to find differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed junctions in the samples.
