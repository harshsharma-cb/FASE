Description: Pipeline for RNA Sequencing data analysis and Alternative Splicing. FASE can be used for finding Cassette Exon/Intron Retention events, Structure and Concentration of different transcripts expressed in treated and normal condition(s). It also contains wrapper functions to find Differentially Expressed Genes and Differentially Expressed Junctions.
